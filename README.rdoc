This is a fullstack application inspired by the popular website reddit.com. It implements a RESTful API and has
typical user authentication with BCrypt for password encryptiong.

Users have the ability to post links, upvote or downvote links, create and comment on posts.

It was created using Ruby on Rails and Backbone.js and overrides the parse
method in Backbone to create the same associations found in the Rails backend.
